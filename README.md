# PHP2530-Final-Paper
This paper investigates sparse representations for high-dimensional image data using classical PCA, frequentist Sparse PCA, and two Bayesian approaches: ARD and Spike-and-Slab priors. Applied to the Olivetti Faces dataset, each method is evaluated through visualizations, reconstruction accuracy, and proportion of variance explained.
